#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Check every layer of a running local service stack in one command, so a
# diagnosis a reader would otherwise assemble from a chain of probes costs one
# run instead of twenty minutes.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/fm-stack-doctor.sh [--conf <path>] [--records] [--help]
#
# The stack to check is a list of layer records, so this command checks any
# layer rather than one project:
#
#   app     |name|port|health-url|source-dir|log-path
#   gateway |name|port|health-url|state-dir|log-path|front-port|front-name
#
# Every path is used exactly as written, so a relative log path resolves
# against the caller's working directory.
#
# The shipped default is the beads-bridge app behind the MCPJungle gateway,
# described in fm_sd_default_records below.
# A host overrides or extends it with FM_STACK_DOCTOR_CONF, or with
# config/stack-doctor.conf in its Firstmate home, where a later record with the
# same kind and name replaces the shipped one and a new kind or name adds a
# layer, so tracked code never carries one machine's own inventory.
# FM_STACK_DOCTOR_BUDGET sets the whole-run deadline in seconds, default 30.
#
# Every layer prints evidence, never a verdict about the reader's setup: a pid,
# a port, a bind address, an uptime, a deployed revision, a probe status, a URL,
# a session id, a tool count, a log path.
# Where a fact is unmeasurable on this host, the line says so with an explicit
# unknown or unmeasured marker rather than dropping the line, because a missing
# line reads as "nothing to report" when it usually means "not measured".
#
# Line protocol, one layer per line, stable for script consumers:
#   [tools]   <subject>  the probe tools this host has, and the resolved config
#   [app]     <name>     process, listen address, launchd label, working
#                        directory, deployed revision, health probe
#   [gateway] <name>     process, listen address, launchd label, health probe,
#                        and the local reverse proxy fronting it
#   [group]   <name>     included servers, endpoint, then the real handshake
#   [tailnet] <subject>  the same handshake again over the tailnet URL for every
#                        group, the public funnel answer for the same path, and
#                        the limits of what either one proves
#   [exposure] <subject> every tailscale serve and funnel mapping, which layer
#                        each reaches, and whether each layer is reachable from
#                        the tailnet, from the public internet, or neither
#   [traffic] <subject>  the newest request each log recorded, where it came
#                        from, and what the caller identity columns can prove
#   [logs]    <subject>  what each log is authoritative for, the shape of the
#                        paths it records, and what it does not record
#   [summary] doctor     layer count, down count, elapsed time, verdict
#
# It exits non-zero when any layer is down, so it works as a check, and zero
# when every layer answered, including when an answer was an explicit unknown.
#
# This command is read-only apart from the MCP probes it must send to prove a
# route works: one initialize and one tools/list per group, which the gateway
# and its upstream servers record in their own logs.
