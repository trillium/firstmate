# Spawn a direct report: a crewmate in a treehouse or Orca worktree, or a
# secondmate in its isolated firstmate home.
# Usage: fm-spawn.sh <task-id> <project-dir> --mode <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only> --yolo <on|off> [--harness <name>|harness|launch-command] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>] [--backend <name>] [--account <N>] [--label <string>] [--beads <id>]

#   <project-dir> takes the same forms fm-brief.sh's <repo-name> takes: a bare
#   project name or "projects/<name>" resolving under $FM_HOME/projects (or
#   FM_PROJECTS_OVERRIDE), or an explicit absolute or relative path, which wins
#   as written. bin/fm-project-dir-lib.sh owns that mapping so the two halves of
#   a dispatch cannot disagree about what a project string names. A project that
#   resolves nowhere is a named error here, not a raw cd failure at launch time.
#   An unrecognized --flag is rejected rather than taken as a positional; pass
#   "--" first for the rare positional that must itself start with "--".
#   --mode and --yolo are this task's delivery contract, REQUIRED for every ship
#   spawn and refused on --scout and --secondmate spawns. Firstmate resolves both
#   per task at intake (AGENTS.md section 7); data/projects.md holds the captain's
#   standing posture as context, not as this task's answer, so a spawn never looks
#   the mode up. A ship spawn additionally reads the brief's recorded
#   "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>" line and REFUSES a mismatch, so the worker's
#   instructions and the recorded task delivery cannot drift apart; a brief
#   scaffolded before that line existed warns once and launches on the flag. When
#   the explicit mode carries less rigor than the project's standing posture, a
#   loud one-line deviation notice is printed and the spawn continues.
#   no-mistakes-prod-only is a registry policy rather than a task mode and is
#   refused as a flag value.
#        fm-spawn.sh <task-id> --relaunch [--harness <name>] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>]
#   --relaunch launches a replacement agent for an EXISTING task into that
#   task's own recorded endpoint and worktree instead of creating either. It is
#   the launch half of the control plane (bin/fm-control.sh relaunch), which
#   owns the checkpoint, the progress note, stopping the previous agent, and the
#   transaction; call fm-control rather than this flag directly unless you are
#   deliberately re-launching an already-stopped task. Every identity axis -
#   backend, kind, project or home, worktree, endpoint - comes from the task's
#   validated state/<id>.meta, so --backend, --scout, --secondmate, a project
#   positional, and batch pairs are all refused alongside it; only harness,
#   model, and effort may change, which is what makes a harness switch one
#   ordinary relaunch. It refuses unless the recorded endpoint is positively
#   agent-free on a backend with a recovery-grade agent-state classifier (tmux
#   or herdr), refuses unless the endpoint's shell is sitting in the recorded
#   worktree, and clears the previous harness's per-task wiring before arming
#   the new incarnation.
#   --harness <name> is the explicit per-spawn harness/profile adapter. The old
#   positional harness arg still works for back-compat.
#   --model <name> and --effort <low|medium|high|xhigh|max> are concrete profile
#   axes chosen by firstmate at intake. They are only threaded into harnesses whose
#   installed CLIs were verified to support that axis; unsupported axes are omitted
#   from that harness's launch rather than guessed. --model is REQUIRED on every
#   ship, scout, or secondmate spawn on a named/templated harness (see the raw
#   launch command and --relaunch notes above for the two exemptions); a spawn
#   refuses closed rather than falling through to the harness's own implicit
#   default model.
#   --account <N> is the optional per-account Claude Code isolation index (see
#   docs/configuration.md "Multi-account Claude Code"). It requires the claude
#   harness, records account=N in the task's meta, sets CLAUDE_TRUST_DIR to the
#   task's worktree in the crewmate's launch environment, and launches through
#   bin/claude-account.sh N instead of the plain claude binary. Absent means
#   current behavior: plain claude, no account isolation.
#   --backend <name> is the explicit runtime session-provider backend for this
#   exact task only (docs/configuration.md "Runtime backend" owns when that flag
#   is authorized). Without it, the script resolves FM_BACKEND, then
#   config/backend, then runtime auto-detection from the runtime firstmate's
#   environment: $TMUX, HERDR_ENV=1, or cmux runtime signals (via
#   bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_detect, with cmux fallback details in
#   docs/cmux-backend.md),
#   then tmux.
#   Spawn-capable backends are the reference tmux adapter and experimental
#   herdr, zellij, orca, and cmux. Orca owns both the task worktree and
#   terminal, so ship/scout Orca spawns do not run treehouse get; cmux is a
#   session provider only, exactly like herdr/zellij, so it does. An
#   auto-detected herdr or cmux spawn prints a loud stderr notice;
#   auto-detected tmux stays silent; zellij and orca are never auto-detected.
#   codex-app is not a known backend yet; docs/codex-app-backend.md owns that
#   blocked backend contract. Default tmux spawns do not write backend= to meta;
#   absent backend= means tmux. cmux does not support --secondmate spawns yet.
#   A backend spawn refusal (missing dependency, version gate, unauthenticated
#   socket, or unsupported secondmate mode) is terminal for that selected backend;
#   callers must surface it instead of silently retrying another backend.
#   --label <string> overrides the default tab/window label for the spawned task.
#   Without --label, the window is named by the task ID in the form fm-<task-id>.
#   With --label, the window is named fm-<label> instead. Task meta conditionally
#   records label= only when --label was passed at spawn; an absent label= means
#   the default task-ID-derived label was used.
#   A herdr crewmate or scout is placed in the exact workspace of the firstmate
#   or secondmate process launching it, resolved from that process's own herdr
#   pane rather than from a workspace label (herdr enforces no label uniqueness,
#   so a label cannot tell two "firstmate" workspaces apart). A claimed parent
#   identity that is unreadable, contradictory, stale, or from another herdr
#   session stops the spawn before any worker endpoint exists. A launcher
#   outside herdr has no workspace to inherit and uses this home's own labeled
#   workspace, which must then match exactly one. --secondmate is the deliberate
#   exception: it stands up that secondmate home's own workspace.
#   Herdr additionally uses a presentation-only layout by default when the
#   selected client and running server meet the Herdr 0.8.0 floor. The local
#   config/herdr-presentation-spaces file can say off to disable it or on to
#   opt in below that floor; an empty file remains the historical opt-in form.
#   A clean fresh task first writes state/<id>.herdr-presentation atomically,
#   then creates a disposable
#   workspace containing only the ordinary task pane. A successful clean create
#   upgrades its attempt journal with exact home, session, workspace, tab, pane,
#   parent, and label bindings. On a same-identity restart, that complete binding
#   plus authoritative metadata may replace one exact agent-free husk in place.
#   The journal, visible token, and labels alone are never endpoint or ownership
#   authority, and every ambiguous recovery stays on the flat fallback after
#   duplicate-agent risk is independently absent. Treehouse allocation and task
#   metadata are unchanged.
#   A clean projected create or exact resume makes one bounded attempt to hold
#   the one session-scoped presentation-order lock (keyed by named session plus
#   canonical socket, outside any home's state/) through launch handoff. Lock
#   contention warns and falls back to the ordinary flat layout before any
#   projection mutation. The exact response-derived new workspace is inserted
#   immediately after its owning parent (firstmate or 2ndmate-<id>) contiguous
#   child block. Ordering never authorizes lifecycle cleanup, and any
#   unavailable, ambiguous, or failed move warns while the spawn continues.
#   Every projected create, prune, and move captures and verifies the named
#   session's exact active workspace and tab. A detected focus change restores
#   only that exact tab id; an ambiguous pre-operation snapshot refuses the
#   focus-sensitive presentation mutation.
#   Every single-task invocation holds one task-id-scoped lock across backend
#   creation through metadata publication, so concurrent same-id spawns serialize
#   even when they select different backends. A fresh spawn first takes the
#   per-home task-set lock and refuses rather than waits when forced teardown owns
#   it; relaunch is exempt because the existing task's control lock covers it.
#   With no harness arg, a crewmate/scout spawn resolves the CREW harness only when
#   config/crew-dispatch.json is absent. When that file exists, crewmate/scout
#   spawns require an explicit harness so firstmate cannot silently skip dispatch
#   profile consultation. A --secondmate spawn is exempt and resolves the SECONDMATE
#   harness (config/secondmate-harness -> config/crew-harness -> own), so the
#   secondmate-vs-crewmate split is DURABLE across every respawn (recovery,
#   /updatefirstmate, restart). A bare adapter name (claude|codex|opencode|pi|pi-signed|grok|kimi|muse)
#   overrides it for this spawn (either kind). A non-flag string containing
#   whitespace is treated as a RAW launch command - the escape hatch for verifying
#   new adapters. pi-signed launches that exact executable name from PATH and
#   refuses before endpoint creation when it is unavailable; it never falls back to pi.
#   A raw launch command embeds its own full argv, so it is exempt from the
#   explicit-model requirement below; the raw command itself should pin a model.
#   Every OTHER ship, scout, or secondmate spawn (named/templated harness) REQUIRES
#   an explicit --model: fm-spawn refuses (nothing launched, no meta written) rather
#   than falling through to the harness's own implicit default, which is never a
#   deliberately chosen model. The error names a per-harness model-discovery command
#   (also: the harness-adapters skill's "Model support discovery" table). --relaunch
#   is exempt (bin/fm-control.sh relaunch owns that axis).
#   config/secondmate-harness may also carry an optional model and effort as extra
#   whitespace-separated tokens ("<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]"). For a
#   --secondmate spawn, those tokens apply only when this spawn also resolves its
#   harness from config/secondmate-harness. An explicit per-spawn --harness,
#   positional harness arg, or raw launch command starts with clean model/effort
#   defaults unless the caller also passes explicit --model/--effort flags. When
#   the file governs the spawn, its model/effort tokens are re-resolved on every
#   respawn exactly like the harness axis, and explicit --model/--effort flags
#   still win over the file's tokens.
#   A --secondmate spawn also propagates the primary's declared inherited local
#   material, so the secondmate's OWN crewmates inherit primary config and the
#   secondmate receives the primary's read-only shared captain-preference file
#   (fm-config-inherit-lib.sh). A successful launch clears pending inherited
#   config reread generations because the new agent reads the converged files.
#   --scout records kind=scout in the task's meta (report deliverable, scratch worktree;
#   see AGENTS.md task lifecycle); --secondmate records kind=secondmate and launches in a
#   provisioned firstmate home; the default is kind=ship.
#   --beads <id> links this task to an external bead item for lifecycle tracking: the id is
#   recorded as beads_id= in the task's meta (fm-teardown.sh reads it to close the bead once
#   this task's work is confirmed landed), the dispatch=sent and lifecycle=sent state
#   dimensions are stamped via fm-bead-stamp.sh after spawn, and the brief includes Bead
#   Receipt/Closure sections (when FM_HOOK_BEADS_ID is set) asking the worker to confirm
#   dispatch=claimed/lifecycle=claimed and close the bead on completion. Under
#   config/backlog-backend=beads, this whole linkage is automatic for every ship/scout
#   spawn (an explicit --beads still wins): fm_beads_resolve_or_create looks up or mints a
#   bead labeled task:<home-scope>:<task-id> (bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh), so beads_id= is
#   always populated and the claim/close lifecycle applies to every dispatch, not just
#   opted-in ones
#   (beads-authority migration Stage 3). --secondmate launches stay exempt (a secondmate
#   home is an operational entity, not a backlog work item). Under the default tasks-axi
#   or manual backends, --beads remains the deliberate opt-in cross-reference, unchanged.
#   Before a secondmate launch, the home is locally fast-forwarded to the primary
#   default-branch commit when safe; skipped syncs warn and launch unchanged.
#   Ship/scout spawns refuse to launch unless the resolved task path is a real
#   git worktree root distinct from the primary project checkout.
# Batch dispatch: pass one or more `id=repo` pairs instead of a single <id> <project>, e.g.
#     fm-spawn.sh fix-a-k3=projects/foo add-b-q7=projects/bar [--scout]
#   Each pair re-execs this script in single-task mode, so the single path stays the only
#   source of truth; shared --scout/--harness/--model/--effort/--backend/--label/--mode/--yolo
#   applies to every pair. A ship batch therefore carries one delivery contract, and each
#   pair still checks it against its own brief; a batch spanning modes is two invocations.
#   If config/crew-dispatch.json exists, shared --harness is required for crewmate
#   and scout batches. The loop lives here, in bash, so callers never hand-write a
#   multi-task shell loop (the tool shell is zsh, which does not word-split unquoted
#   $vars and silently breaks ad-hoc `for ... in $pairs` loops).
#   Launch templates live in launch_template() below; placeholders replaced before launch:
#     __BRIEF__    absolute path to data/<task-id>/brief.md
#     __TURNEND__  absolute path to state/<task-id>.turn-ended (for harnesses whose
#                  turn-end signal rides the launch command, e.g. codex -c notify=[...])
#     __PIEXT__    absolute path to state/<task-id>.pi-ext.ts (pi turn-end extension,
#                  written by this script; outside the worktree to avoid pi's trust gate)
#     __PITURNEND__ absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts in a pi secondmate home
#     __PIWATCH__   absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts in a pi secondmate home
#     __OPINPUT__   absolute path to the canonical operational-input encoder
# Verified per-harness turn-end hooks are installed automatically where enabled; some live outside the worktree.
# Kimi uses one surgically installed Firstmate region in $HOME/.kimi-code/config.toml,
# a firstmate-owned global hook and registry, and a gitignored per-task pointer.
# grok uses a firstmate-owned global hook under ${GROK_HOME:-$HOME/.grok}/hooks
# plus a gitignored .fm-grok-turnend worktree pointer and a state token.
# A confirmed launch also best-effort enrolls the new agent in Parlay's live chat
# panel via `parlay listen --agent <task-id>`, backgrounded with its pid recorded to
# state/<id>.parlay-listen-pid for fm-teardown.sh to stop. Skipped when
# FM_SPAWN_SKIP_PARLAY=1 (set by tests/lib.sh for all test-suite spawns). Parlay is
# optional captain tooling, never load-bearing: an absent `parlay` binary, a failed
# call, or the skip guard never blocks or fails the spawn.
# muse installs no hook at all - its plugin engine is off in the default build - so
# it writes state/<id>.muse-session to bind the pane to muse's own session event
# log; muse is crewmate/scout only and is refused for --secondmate.
#
# FIRST-TURN WATCHDOG. The launch prompt is TYPED into a pane, so the launch
# itself proves nothing about whether the agent read it: under load that line
# can be lost, leaving an agent parked at an empty composer having consumed
# nothing while this script reported success. After the launch, every spawn
# confirms the agent actually STARTED a turn before returning.
# bin/fm-firstturn-lib.sh owns the proof (the semantic busy-state record, which
# harnesses it can prove, and why); this script owns the response. When a first
# turn provably did NOT fire and the pane is still up, the brief pointer
# ("Read the brief at <path> and follow it exactly.") is resubmitted exactly
# once through fm_backend_send_text_submit, then re-confirmed. Resubmission is
# safe only because the not-fired verdict PROVES nothing was consumed; an
# unproven verdict is never resubmitted into, so no charter can be duplicated.
# Every launch appends one record to state/.firstturn.log:
#   <ts> id= harness= backend= outcome=<outcome> detail=<detail>
#   fired-normally           the launch prompt started a turn
#   resubmitted-confirmed    it did not; the pointer was resent and confirmed
#   resubmitted-unconfirmed  it did not, and the resubmission was not confirmed
#   resubmit-send-failed     it did not, and the pointer could not be typed
#   not-running              it did not, and no agent is running (launch command
#                            failed, so typing a pointer would not recover it)
#   unproven                 no verdict is possible; detail names why
#                            (no-semantic-source for codex/grok/kimi/muse and
#                            any unverified adapter, secondmate-unarmed for a
#                            secondmate launch, plus malformed/gen-mismatch/
#                            firstmate-source/foreign-source/unexpected-seq,
#                            or disabled)
# A secondmate is never armed, so it is short-circuited to unproven WITHOUT
# waiting: the poll could only ever time out, and paying that on every
# secondmate launch would buy nothing.
# Anything other than fired-normally, resubmitted-confirmed, or unproven also
# appends a `blocked:` event to state/<id>.status so a launch that quietly
# failed to land wakes firstmate instead of passing as a clean success.
# Knobs: FM_SPAWN_FIRSTTURN=off disables the whole block (the launch behaves
# exactly as it did before, and the log records detail=disabled);
# FM_SPAWN_FIRSTTURN_POLLS (120) and FM_SPAWN_FIRSTTURN_INTERVAL (0.5) bound the
# wait, which returns the instant a turn is proven, so a healthy launch costs
# one read; FM_SPAWN_FIRSTTURN_RESUBMIT_POLLS (FM_SPAWN_FIRSTTURN_POLLS) bounds
# the post-resubmission wait; FM_SPAWN_FIRSTTURN_SUBMIT_RETRIES (3),
# FM_SPAWN_FIRSTTURN_SUBMIT_SLEEP (FM_SPAWN_FIRSTTURN_INTERVAL), and
# FM_SPAWN_FIRSTTURN_SUBMIT_SETTLE (0) are passed straight to the submit
# primitive. docs/configuration.md owns the schema.
# The watchdog is independent of Parlay: it uses no optional tooling at all.
#
# OPTIONAL PARLAY CLAIM PROMPT. Default OFF. With config/spawn-claim-prompt set
# to `on`, a bead-linked crewmate or scout is launched against a short
# `parlay claim <bead>` prompt instead of its whole encoded brief, which is the
# shape `parlay claim` is designed for. bin/fm-claim-prompt-lib.sh owns the gate
# and the prompt text; this script owns only the substitution. The claim it
# emits pins --agent to this task id and passes --silent, so the one agent
# keeps the single Parlay identity this script already enrolled it under and
# never arms a second listen loop beside the one teardown owns.
# The ONLY thing that changes is which file the launch templates'
# `__OPINPUT__ encode launch-brief < __BRIEF__` reads: the operational-input
# encoding contract, every harness template, and every launch flag are
# untouched, and $BRIEF is never reassigned, so BRIEF_REAL and the watchdog's
# recovery pointer keep naming the real brief. The prompt is written beside the
# brief at data/<id>/claim-prompt.md, and it NAMES that brief and declares it
# authoritative, so a claim that fails at the agent's end still lands on the
# full contract rather than on a truncated one.
# Gate (any one degrades to the brief, i.e. to the behaviour above):
#   disabled     the flag is absent or is not exactly `on`
#   secondmate   a secondmate carries a charter, not a bead-backed work item
#   no-bead      the task has no beads_id=
#   no-parlay    the parlay binary is not installed
#   unreachable  the bounded `parlay subscribers` probe did not answer
# Degrading is not a second code path: it feeds the same $BRIEF the spawn always
# fed, so a default home's launch command and state/<id>.meta are byte-identical
# to what they were before this existed. state/<id>.meta records claim_prompt=on
# only when the prompt was actually used, and a --relaunch re-decides rather
# than inheriting it. Knob: FM_SPAWN_CLAIM_PROBE_TIMEOUT (10) bounds the probe,
# which can only ever degrade the launch, never block it. docs/configuration.md
# owns the schema.
# On success prints: spawned <id> harness=<name> kind=<ship|scout|secondmate> [mode=<mode> yolo=<on|off>] window=<backend-target> worktree=<path>
# A ship task records the explicit mode/yolo it was passed; a secondmate spawn records
# mode=secondmate, yolo=off, home=, and projects=; a scout records neither, and both the
# success line and state/<id>.meta omit them.
# --beads <id> links the spawn to a beads issue; meta records beads_id= when set.
# Applies only to ship/scout spawns, not --secondmate.
# When the home session's frozen trace-context decision is enabled (see
# docs/configuration.md and bin/fm-trace-context-lib.sh), the meta also records
# one W3C traceparent= carrier, the same value injected into the pane as
# TRACEPARENT; the default-off path writes neither, leaving the generated meta
# and launch environment unchanged.
#   --traceparent <carrier> delivers a carrier that a REMOTE parent already
#   resolved and will record, instead of resolving one from this home's frozen
#   decision. It is accepted only for --secondmate spawns, only as a strictly
#   validated W3C traceparent, and exists because a remote secondmate's task
#   identity is owned by the parent home that holds its task metadata, while the
#   pane export happens on the remote host (bin/fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh).
#   Local spawns never pass it and resolve their own carrier exactly as before.
# After a successful spawn, every executable in bin/fm-spawn-hooks.d/ is sourced
# (in its own subshell, so a hook's own exit cannot end this script) with
# FM_HOOK_ID, FM_HOOK_HARNESS, FM_HOOK_BEADS_ID, FM_HOOK_WINDOW, FM_HOOK_STATE,
# and FM_HOOK_ROOT set. Absent or empty fm-spawn-hooks.d/ is a no-op. This is
# the extension point for out-of-tree post-spawn behavior (for example beads
# dispatch tracking) so this file stays a pure addition target.
